# 3D Reconstruction: Projective and Euclidean Methods

## Introduction
This project implements the process of 3D reconstruction using MATLAB, starting from projective reconstruction to transitioning into Euclidean space. It involves reading image points, computing the fundamental matrix, defining camera matrices, triangulating points, and visualizing both projective and Euclidean reconstructions.

## Features
- **Projective Reconstruction**: Utilizes homologous image points for initial projective reconstruction.
- **Euclidean Reconstruction**: Applies control points and homography to transition from projective to Euclidean reconstruction.
- **Visualization**: Includes functionalities to visualize the reconstructed points in 3D space, showcasing the transition from projective to Euclidean geometry.

## Technologies
- **MATLAB**: The entire reconstruction process, including matrix computations, triangulation, and visualization, is carried out in MATLAB.
